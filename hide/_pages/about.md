Hi! I’m **Yuchuan Deng (邓钰川)**, a Ph.D. student at the [AI & Media Computing Lab (AIMC Lab)](https://ruc-aimc-lab.github.io/), [Renmin University of China (RUC)](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Xirong Li](https://lixirong.net/).

I received my **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Technology** from the [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), [Sichuan University (SCU)](https://www.scu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Qijun Zhao](http://www.scubrl.org/qjzhao).

My research interests include **resource-efficient multimodal large language models**, **ophthalmology-oriented multimodal LLMs**, and **multimodal video retrieval**.
